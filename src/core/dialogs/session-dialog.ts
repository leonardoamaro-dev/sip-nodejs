  /**
   * Terminating a Session
   *
   * This section describes the procedures for terminating a session
   * established by SIP.  The state of the session and the state of the
   * dialog are very closely related.  When a session is initiated with an
   * INVITE, each 1xx or 2xx response from a distinct UAS creates a
   * dialog, and if that response completes the offer/answer exchange, it
   * also creates a session.  As a result, each session is "associated"
   * with a single dialog - the one which resulted in its creation.  If an
   * initial INVITE generates a non-2xx final response, that terminates
   * all sessions (if any) and all dialogs (if any) that were created
   * through responses to the request.  By virtue of completing the
   * transaction, a non-2xx final response also prevents further sessions
   * from being created as a result of the INVITE.  The BYE request is
   * used to terminate a specific session or attempted session.  In this
   * case, the specific session is the one with the peer UA on the other
   * side of the dialog.  When a BYE is received on a dialog, any session
   * associated with that dialog SHOULD terminate.  A UA MUST NOT send a
   * BYE outside of a dialog.  The caller's UA MAY send a BYE for either
   * confirmed or early dialogs, and the callee's UA MAY send a BYE on
   * confirmed dialogs, but MUST NOT send a BYE on early dialogs.
   *
   * However, the callee's UA MUST NOT send a BYE on a confirmed dialog
   * until it has received an ACK for its 2xx response or until the server
   * transaction times out.  If no SIP extensions have defined other
   * application layer states associated with the dialog, the BYE also
   * terminates the dialog.
