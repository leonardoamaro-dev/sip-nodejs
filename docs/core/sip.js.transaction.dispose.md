## Transaction.dispose() method

Destructor. Once the transaction is in the "terminated" state, it is destroyed immediately and there is no need to call `dispose`<!-- -->. However, if a transaction needs to be ended prematurely, the transaction user may do so by calling this method (for example, perhaps the UA is shutting down). No state transition will occur upon calling this method, all outstanding transmission timers will be cancelled, and use of the transaction after calling `dispose` is undefined.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
dispose(): void;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`void`
