## UserAgentServer.receiveCancel() method

If the UAS did not find a matching transaction for the CANCEL according to the procedure above, it SHOULD respond to the CANCEL with a 481 (Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist). If the transaction for the original request still exists, the behavior of the UAS on receiving a CANCEL request depends on whether it has already sent a final response for the original request. If it has, the CANCEL request has no effect on the processing of the original request, no effect on any session state, and no effect on the responses generated for the original request. If the UAS has not issued a final response for the original request, its behavior depends on the method of the original request. If the original request was an INVITE, the UAS SHOULD immediately respond to the INVITE with a 487 (Request Terminated). A CANCEL request has no impact on the processing of transactions with any other method defined in this specification. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-9.2
