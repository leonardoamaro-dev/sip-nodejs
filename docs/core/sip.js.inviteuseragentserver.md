## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(core, message, delegate)](./sip.js.inviteuseragentserver._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>InviteUserAgentServer</code> class |

## Properties

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [accept(options)](./sip.js.inviteuseragentserver.accept.md) |  | 13.3.1.4 The INVITE is Accepted The UAS core generates a 2xx response. This response establishes a dialog, and therefore follows the procedures of Section 12.1.1 in addition to those of Section 8.2.6. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-13.3.1.4 |
|  [dispose()](./sip.js.inviteuseragentserver.dispose.md) |  |  |
|  [progress(options)](./sip.js.inviteuseragentserver.progress.md) |  | 13.3.1.1 Progress If the UAS is not able to answer the invitation immediately, it can choose to indicate some kind of progress to the UAC (for example, an indication that a phone is ringing). This is accomplished with a provisional response between 101 and 199. These provisional responses establish early dialogs and therefore follow the procedures of Section 12.1.1 in addition to those of Section 8.2.6. A UAS MAY send as many provisional responses as it likes. Each of these MUST indicate the same dialog ID. However, these will not be delivered reliably.<!-- -->If the UAS desires an extended period of time to answer the INVITE, it will need to ask for an "extension" in order to prevent proxies from canceling the transaction. A proxy has the option of canceling a transaction when there is a gap of 3 minutes between responses in a transaction. To prevent cancellation, the UAS MUST send a non-100 provisional response at every minute, to handle the possibility of lost provisional responses. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-13.3.1.1 |
|  [redirect(contacts, options)](./sip.js.inviteuseragentserver.redirect.md) |  | 13.3.1.2 The INVITE is Redirected If the UAS decides to redirect the call, a 3xx response is sent. A 300 (Multiple Choices), 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Moved Temporarily) response SHOULD contain a Contact header field containing one or more URIs of new addresses to be tried. The response is passed to the INVITE server transaction, which will deal with its retransmissions. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-13.3.1.2 |
|  [reject(options)](./sip.js.inviteuseragentserver.reject.md) |  | 13.3.1.3 The INVITE is Rejected A common scenario occurs when the callee is currently not willing or able to take additional calls at this end system. A 486 (Busy Here) SHOULD be returned in such a scenario. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261\#section-13.3.1.3 |
