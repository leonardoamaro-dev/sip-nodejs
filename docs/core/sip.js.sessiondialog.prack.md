## SessionDialog.prack() method

Assuming the response is to be transmitted reliably, the UAC MUST create a new request with method PRACK. This request is sent within the dialog associated with the provisional response (indeed, the provisional response may have created the dialog). PRACK requests MAY contain bodies, which are interpreted according to their type and disposition. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3262\#section-4

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
prack(delegate?: OutgoingRequestDelegate, options?: RequestOptions): OutgoingPrackRequest;
