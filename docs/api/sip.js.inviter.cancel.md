## Inviter.cancel() method

Cancels the INVITE request.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
cancel(options?: InviterCancelOptions): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  options | <code>InviterCancelOptions</code> | Options bucket. |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<void>`

## Remarks

Sends a CANCEL request. Resolves once the response sent, otherwise rejects.

After sending a CANCEL request the expectation is that a 487 final response will be received for the INVITE. However a 200 final response to the INVITE may nonetheless arrive (it's a race between the CANCEL reaching the UAS before the UAS sends a 200) in which case an ACK &amp; BYE will be sent. The net effect is that this method will terminate the session regardless of the race.
