## Transport.connect() method

Connect to network.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
connect(): Promise<void>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<void>`

## Remarks


```txt
- If `state` is "Connecting", `state` MUST NOT transition before returning.
- If `state` is "Connected", `state` MUST NOT transition before returning.
- If `state` is "Disconnecting", `state` MUST transition to "Connecting" before returning.
- If `state` is "Disconnected" `state` MUST transition to "Connecting" before returning.
- The `state` MUST transition to "Connected" before resolving (assuming `state` is not already "Connected").
- The `state` MUST transition to "Disconnecting" or "Disconnected" before rejecting and MUST reject with an Error.

```
Resolves when the transport connects. Rejects if transport fails to connect. Rejects with [StateTransitionError](./sip.js.statetransitionerror.md) if a loop is detected. In particular, callbacks and emitters MUST NOT call this method synchronously.
