|  Terminated | <code>&quot;Terminated&quot;</code> | If <code>Inviter</code>, sent INVITE and received non-200 final response (or sent/received BYE after receiving 200). If <code>Invitation</code>, received INVITE and sent non-200 final response (or sent/received BYE after sending 200). |
|  Terminating | <code>&quot;Terminating&quot;</code> | If <code>Inviter</code>, sent INVITE, sent CANCEL and now waiting for 487 final response to ACK (or 200 to ACK &amp; BYE). If <code>Invitation</code>, received INVITE, sent 200 final response and now waiting on ACK and upon receipt will attempt BYE (as the protocol specification requires, before sending a BYE we must receive the ACK - so we are waiting). |
